                    Live music is a weekly event held by Farbucks. Held every Saturday and Sunday because on those days many customers come to relax their minds for a full week of activities. This weekly live music will be performed by local bands or youth bands. The songs that will be sung are also songs that are trending at that time, so it is certain that customers will not feel bored with the songs that are sung. They can also request songs from bands that are currently performing.</p>

                        Open Mic is an event that is held every two weeks on Thursday nights. This event will be filled with a comedy or poetry reading from customers or from the cafe that has been provided. Open Mic was held to attract visitors and fill the cafe atmosphere on weekdays. Why do we schedule it on weekdays because we think this can cheer up the visitors who come to the cafe because they are tired after work.</p>

                        Coffee Shop Classes is an event held by Farbucks twice a month on Saturdays and Sundays. This class was held because it wanted to introduce to the wider community how to make coffee with interesting dishes and various flavors. We also schedule holidays so as not to disturb the schedules of those who want to take the class. In this class, they will get a souvenir such as a t-shirt, or some other things.</p>
